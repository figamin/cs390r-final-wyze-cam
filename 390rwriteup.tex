\section{Overview}
The Wyze Cam V2 is a low cost security camera (MSRP \$26) developed by Wyze Labs, Inc. As with most Wyze cameras, it is largely a licenced copy of an existing Xiaomi camera, in this case being based on the Xiaomi Xiaofang 1S. \verb|\use this for commands|\newline\newline
Some notable features of this camera include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1080p sensor with a 110 degree wide angle lens
    \item F2.0 aperture + 4 infrared LEDs, good for low light
    \item Speaker \& microphone for two way communication, so it can be used as an intercom
    \item Accompanying mobile app to see live video feed, capture images \& bitrate information 
  \end{itemize}
